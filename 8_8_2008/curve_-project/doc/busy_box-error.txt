today a idea, suddeny comes to me that
i will try to mount my mp3 on /mp3 on arm in the boot script /bin/qtopia
then to read any write it as local flash using Qfile
but i fail to do so finally
error
mount /dev/..../disk no such file or directory
even though my mp3 is already pluged in.
but maybe the file has not been set uo in dev/...yet
so it seems that i have to mount afer the system boots up fully
but i see the below error
*******************
root@FriendlyARM /]# mount /dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/disc  mp3/
yaffs: Attempting MTD mount on 8.0, "(unavailable)"
mount: permission denied. (are you root?)
[root@FriendlyARM /]# su
sh: can't access tty; job control turned off
**************
as they teach me
i
#cd /dev
#rm console
but error:
rm: unable to remove `console': Operation not permitted
**
so maybe i'd better stop here now, anyway the busybox still works well now
maybe one day i can try to change it into yctek busybox.
**
i see another problem as well when i am trying to do this, 
if you plug in the mp3 on arm before arm is power on.
there will be nothing show up on the screen even the logo.
that must due to the limited power supply.
