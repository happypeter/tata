see debug_ad_2 first

*********

search 'ADCCON' in 2410_ts.c, you will see clearly how this driver

manipulates ADCCON. it's actually very simple.

NOW,I see that if you want your ad to work, if there is no ts.c, 

all you need to do to ADCCON are:

1. writel(S3C2410_ADCCON_PRSCEN | S3C2410_ADCCON_PRSCVL(info->presc&0xFF),\
			     base_addr+S3C2410_ADCCON);

2. writel(readl(base_addr+S3C2410_ADCCON) | S3C2410_ADCCON_ENABLE_START,\
                             base_addr+S3C2410_ADCCON);

that's enough

**
of course we need to do something to ADCTSC as well,

i am not sure but i believe write 0 to it will do!

*******************
today is 7_20_2008, i want to stop this project now

and continue in the future

next time i start, first thing is to know more about 2410_ts.c

or recompile a new kernel without it

******************
ok i am back!

when the kernel without ts driver is running, the ad_v2b message is different now

see /doc/debug/ad_v2b message,

this makes happy, because everything works as expected.

but then i encounter a foolish trap,

see /doc/debug/why is that

anyway, i see the output data, when the old kernel was running,

but now everything stops i a dead loop, because, the ADCCON[15] refuses to

because 0, so somthing must have been missed.

i need to cheek it in ts.c.
******
ad_v2c

i study all in /reference/driver code and find out 

if there is nothing else using ADC, there is nothing u need to do about ADCTSC

in your driver (see ads-2410adc)

otherwise, you write 0 or clear the last there bits, that's enough.

now that my ADCTSC=0x58, so no action is required of course.

but why my ADCCON[15] is always 0

so i finally believe ad_v2c shall be right to read adc,

but actually ad still refuse to work,

there is nothing i can do now... 
*******

ad_v2ca

in ts.c, i see clk_get()

people say that newer kernel do not require it.

but it is definetely a must for me now!!!

but i do not where to put all these functions,

i don't know driver structure well enough.

i wirte ad_v2ca, but it does not work alright

see ../error messages/ad_v2ca messages
