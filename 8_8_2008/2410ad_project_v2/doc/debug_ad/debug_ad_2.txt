haha, with the help of code/forefather and 2410UM

i think now i see how AD wroks

now let's go all the way back to ad_v2

***************
ad_v2a+ad_app_v2

we are getting closer to the truth!

see doc/ad_v2a message

the interesting thing is seen when you pay attention to the

6th printf number:

if you connect chanel0 to Vref

then it is always 1023

otherwise, it varies everytime you issue ./ad2

but then all the output is under 1000

haha, my ad works!

**************
ad_v2b

this time i will impletement write(), and see if the bug will go away

in 2410UM
    
   Normal Conversion Mode (AUTO_PST = 0, XY_PST = 0)

so this time i will first add a printk to see whether the two bits

are changed by ts driver?

ANSWER: i see 'before everything, ADCTSC=0x1d3'

this is just the exact value of WAIT4INT(1) in 2410_ts.c!!!

now i understand why in one of my downloaded drivers, 

the author wrote: exclusive with s3c2410-ts.c
**
then i will write 0 to TSC to see if the adc works alright this time

No!
