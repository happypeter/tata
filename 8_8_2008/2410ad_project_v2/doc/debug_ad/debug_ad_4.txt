ad_v2aa

//there is a ts0.tar in /code/adc/driver/ad_v2aa.tar

// this is a ts dirver with WAIT4INT changed into 0

//this way, when it is loaded, the ADCTSC is 0 forever

now tested on both YC board and my board

the ADCTSC is 0 whenever and wherever.

the ADCCON[15] and ADCCON[1] are changed the expected way

that means adc works normally

but the output data is still not right.

ON YC board it is 1023 forever

on my board it is between 1000 and 1023

this is exactly the same when ts.c is not changed

so maybe it is not necessary to do someting to ts driver

just write 000 to the last three bits of ADCTSC in your own dirver

Hm... what is the problem? 

**************
ad_v2ab+ad_app_v3

the output still bigger than 1000

i set CLKCON[15], make no difference
