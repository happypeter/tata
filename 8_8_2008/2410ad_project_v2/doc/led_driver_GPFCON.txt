led_driver_GPFCON 

see the original driver in myblog/drivers/4--led2

so let's start from the simplest

i change

* (volatile unsigned long *)(pREG + 1) = 0xf10;//led4=1, led7=0;

into

S3C2410_GPFDAT=0xf10;

then error:

   invalid lvalue in assignment

then i suddenly realize 

'S3C2410_GPFDAT=0xf10' equals '1=2', because
 
S3C2410_GPFDAT is itself a number, how stupid i am!

but then how to use S3C2410_GPFDAT

// see my artical S3C2410_GPFDAT_usage

//see code/led_readb/led4, and we will know very clear how __raw_writeb()

//works in the place of ioremap
