ts_driver_structure

i want to change the ts driver into the adc driver

in order to use clk_get() a dirty way.

the structure of s3c2410ts.c is actually simple

see /code/2410ts_changing/s3c2410_ts_3

but finally i realize it is not that easy to make the change:

1. input_dev----------------cdev

   init_input_dev-----------cdev_init()

2. in the ts structure no open read wirite available, so i do not know 

   how to use the dirver

so i give it up now, but i will do it later 

shocking to find out that almost all the kernel driver use

probe+remove

rather than

open+release+read+write
