2410_ad.c compilation error
 
first error message is 

<asm/hw_irq.h> wanted by <linux/irq.h> is not found

obviously this is a bug of the YC kernel itself

i believe the problem can be settled by 

#ln -s asm-xxx asm

cause there are seveal asm-xxx in .../include/...

but which is the right one?

it shall be asm-arm of course, and there is already a sybolic link

named asm for asm-arm

but the thing is that there is no hw_irq there!!!

so i do not know what to do about this.

the things above simplely means the header is broken, so just change it.

once i used <asm-arm/arch-s3c2410/io.h>

the same error occured, 

then i thought all i wanted to do is implementing __raw_readl()

so i searched tho kernel source to find out a programm that used

__raw_readl(), so just like that

My bug was fixed by changing the header to <asm/io.h>



***************

another error:

ADCCON not defined

it is easy to fix, in my YC kernel header

/asm/arch-s3c2410/regs-adc.h

the right one for me is 

S3C2410_ADCCON

*********

then some errors like

in

   tmp = PRESCALE_ENDIS | PRSCVL(adcdev.prescale) | ADC_INPUT(adcdev.channel);
   writel( tmp, S3C2410_ADCCON);

all the macros here are not available

that is a piece of cake as well, SEE P416 of 2410UM

and i know i can go without these macros by writting the numeber needed

by ADCCON directly
