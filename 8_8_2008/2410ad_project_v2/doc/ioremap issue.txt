ioremap issue

the author of the adc driver i am debugging now said 

he encountered a error, when the user app is actived:

   ad convert opened!
   Please select which chanel to read....
   0 : chanel--0
   1 : chanel--1
   o
   write number=8, adcdev.prescale=40, adcdev.chanel=0
   Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000004
   pgd = c3e5c000
   [00000004] *pgd=33eca031, *pte=00000000, *ppte=00000000

among all the possibilities, i strrongly believe it is due to the 

absence of ioremap to ADCGON and ADCDATA

am i right?

********

see my artical 

ioremap analysis

and we know the argument of ioremap is physical adress

but i was wrong, things like ADCGON are virtul adress defined by kernel

so no ioremap to them is needed
***********

now i tend to believe the defination in regs-adc.h is buggy

because i see in

/* linux/include/asm-arm/arch-s3c2410/map.h
 
   /* we have a bit of a tight squeeze to fit all our registers from

    * 0xF00000000 upwards, since we use all of the nGCS space in some
    * capacity, and also need to fit the S3C2410 registers in as well...
  

but here the virtual address is 00000004

ok, it's time to sleep, see you tomorrow!

**************
see YC kernel source s3c2410_ts.c

and everything is clear

the secret lies in

    static void __iomem *base_addr;

**

thus we know we do not have to chnge the vitual adress difination in 

regs-adc.h 

although it is quite different from others like watchdog registers

**

so i will first use 'iomem' to fix the bug in ad driver

and maybe i can aslo change the defination in regs-adc.h

know HOW in doc/S3C2410_WDCON adress analysis
