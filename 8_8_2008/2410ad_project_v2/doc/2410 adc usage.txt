2410 adc usage

AVref is N12 on 2410 function as

adc Vref

in the UM we see

  FUNCTION DESCRIPTIONS
  A/D Conversion Time
  When the PCLK frequency is 50 MHz and the prescaler value is 49, total 10-bit conversion time is given:
  A/D converter freq. = 50 MHz/(49+1) = 1 MHz
  Conversion time = 1/(1 MHz / 5cycles) = 1/200 kHz = 5 us
  This A/D converter is designed to operate at maximum 2.5 MHz clock, so the conversion rate can go up to
  500 KSPS.

know more in P414

now we know how to set some bits of ADCCON

***
now where is the output digital value of ADC

in the UM we see:

   XPDATA
   (Normal ADC)
   [9:0] X-position conversion data value. (include Normal ADC conversion data
   value)
   Data value: 0 ~ 3FF

so we know our value is on port ADCDAT0

there is one problem left:

since the ts and other adc chanels all output onto this port

how can we know who is who ?

maybe that is why the sample drivers i get from net 

have sth to do with ADCTSC

see
   AUTO_PST [2] Automatically sequencing conversion of X-position and Y-position
   0 = Normal ADC conversion
   1 = Auto (Sequential) X/Y Position Conversion Mode

and we know maybe a simple

ADCTSC=0

will do

*******
 
the vref on my board is equals my VDD33=3.25v

***************
in UM they say:
   NOTES:
    1. Before ADC conversion, Touch screen uses X-tal clock 
       or EXTCLK (Waiting for Interrupt Mode).
    2. During ADC conversion, PCLK is used.

but do we need to do sth for this?

some writes
   writel((readl(S3C2410_CLKCON) | 1 << 15),S3C2410_CLKCON);

this won't be necessary, 

because the initial value of the S3C2410_CLKCON[15] is 1
