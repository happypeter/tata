I want to port all the svn history to git repo
	sudo apt-get install git-svn
	#do not try to see git-svn in PATH, it is called by "git svn"
	git svn clone -s -r 40000 https://tinylion.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/tinylion
	git svn fetch 

it works

Now I want to merge tata and tinylion

peter@cow:~/x-github/tata$  git remote add tinylion ../tinylion/
peter@cow:~/x-github/tata$ git fetch tinylion
warning: no common commits
remote: Counting objects: 89, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (83/83), done.

From ../tinylion
 * [new branch]      master     -> tinylion/master
peter@cow:~/x-github/tata$ git merge tinylion/master

but the output is not very good.
