last commit we do a revert

	 git revert -m 1 HEAD^

in order to remove all files merged in with commit

	 Merge commit 'tinylion/master'

we do so, becasue we want all the history to hornor the contribution to tata svn repo, but since all the files are already out of date, so we do a revert to clean everything merged in.

Now we can continue our development.
